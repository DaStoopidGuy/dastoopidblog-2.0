# Electric Flux
## Definition
The number of field lines passing through a ceertain area is called electric flux.
- Denoted by $\phi_e$

Electric flux is defined as the dot product of electric intensity and vector area.
Mathematically,
$$
\phi_e = \overset{\rightarrow}{E} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{A} \\
\phi_e = EA\cos \theta \\
unit = \frac{N}{C} m^2 \\
unit = N m^2 C^-1
$$

## Dependance of Electric Flux
Electric flux depends upon,
1. Number of electric lines of force per unit area
1. Area of the surface
1. Orientation of the surface

## Special Case
### Maximum flux
When the surface is held perpendicular, then the electric flux will be maximum.
$$
\phi_e = \overset{\rightarrow}{E} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{A} \\
\phi_e = EA\cos \theta \\
\phi_e = EA\cos 0 \\
(\because \cos 0 \degree = 1) \\
\phi_e = EA \\
$$

### Minimum flux
When the surface is held parallel to the electric field lines, then electric flux will
be minimum.
$$
\phi_e = \overset{\rightarrow}{E} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{A} \\
\phi_e = EA\cos \theta \\
\phi_e = EA\cos 90 \\
(\because \cos 90 \degree = 0) \\
\phi_e = 0 \\
$$

### When area is at angle $\theta$
when surface is held at inclined at some angle $\theta$, the flux will be:
$$
\phi_e = \overset{\rightarrow}{E} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{A} \\
\phi_e = EA\cos \theta \\

$$
