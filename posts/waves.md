# Chapter 8: Waves
## Exercise Questions

### 8.1: What features do longitudinal waves have in common with transverse waves?
### Answer:
1. Both types of waves transport energy.
2. Both types of waves can produce interference, diffraction, refraction.

3. For determination of speed of wave, `v=‚®çùõå` is applicable for both these waves.

### 8.3: Is it possible for two identical waves traveling in the same direction along a string to give rise to a stationary wave?
### Answer:
Stationary waves are produced only when two identical waves move along the same line in opposite directions. Therefore, it is **not possible** for two identical waves traveling in the same direction along a string to give rise to a stationary wave.

---
### 8.4: A wave is produced along a stretched string but some of its particles permanently show zero displacement. What type of wave is it?
### Answer:
**This is a stationary wave.** This is because some of the points of the medium remain permanently stationary _(these are called nodes)_.

---
### 8.5: Explain the terms crest, trough, node and antinode.
### Answer:
**Crest:** A crest the point on a wave with the maximum upward displacement.
**Trough:** A trough the point on a wave with the maximum downward displacement.
**Node:** The points of zero displacement in a stationary wave are called nodes.
**Antinode:** The points of maximum displacement in a stationary wave are called antinodes.

### 8.6: Why does sound travel faster in solids than in gases?
### Answer:
Speed of sound is given by:
```tex
\textcolor{orange}{\boxed{ v= \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}} }}
```
_Where,_
  **E** = Modulus of Elasticity
  **œÅ** = Density of the medium
Even though the density of solids is greater as compared to gases but the modulus of elasticity for solids is much greater as compared to gases.
_So,_
```tex
\textcolor{green}{
\sqrt{\frac{E_{solid}}{\rho_{solid}}}
>
\sqrt{\frac{E_{gas}}{\rho_{gas}}}
}
```
Hence, sound travels faster in solids than in gases.

### 8.7: How are beats useful in tuning musical instruments?
### Answer:
One can use beats to tune a string instrument, such as a piano or violin, by beating a note against a note of known frequency. The string can then be adjusted to the desired frequency by tightening or loosening it until no beats are heard.

---
### 8.8: When two notes of frequencies _f~1~_ and _f~2~_ are sounded together, beats are formed. If _f~1~_ > _f~2~_ , what will be the frequency of the beats? <br> (i) _f~1~_ + _f~2~_ <br>(ii) ¬Ω(_f~1~_ + _f~2~_) <br>(iii) _f~1~_ - _f~2~_ <br>(iv) ¬Ω(_f~2~_ - _f~1~_)
### Answer:
The number of beats produced in one second is equal to the difference in the frequencies of notes.
So:
**Number of beats per second = f~1~ - f~2~**
Hence, the correct answer is (iii).

---
### 8.9: As a result of a distant explosion, an observer senses a ground tremor and then hears the explosion. Explain the time difference.
### Answer:
We know that sound waves travel faster through solids as compared to gases. So the time difference is due to the waves produced by the explosion reaching the observer through solid ground much faster that the sound waves traveling through the air.

---
### 8.10: Explain why sound travels faster in warm air than in cold air.
### Answer:
We know that the expression for speed of sound in air is:
```tex
\textcolor{orange}{
\boxed{v=\sqrt{\frac{rP}{\rho}}}
}
```
Here, we see that speed of sound is inversely proportional to `‚àöœÅ`. Which means that the density of air is greater, speed of sound will be small and vice versa. As warm air has smaller density than that of cold air therefore sound travels faster in warm air than in cold air.

---
### 8.11: How should a sound source move with respect to an observer so that the frequency of its sound does not change?
### Answer:
If both source and observer are in motion such that their relative velocity is zero, then observed frequency does not change. This is because in Doppler Effect, change in the observed frequency is only due to the relative motion of the source and the observer.
