# Ch.3 Data Communication
## Data Communication
Data Communication is the process of transferring data electronically from one place to another using communicaton mediums.
Basic components of data communication are as follows:
- Message
- Sender
- Receiver
- Transmission Medium
- Encoder and Decoder

### 1. Message
Message is the data or information to be communicated. It may consist of Text, Images, Number, etc...
### 2. Sender
Sender is the **device that sends the message**.
Also called **Source** or **Transmitter**.
### 3. Receiver
Receiver is the **device that receives the message**.
Also called **Sink**.
### 4. Transmission Medium
The **path** through which the messages are transferred is called Transmission Medium.
Also called **Communication Channel** or **Communication Medium**.
The transmission medium is a **physical cable** or a **wireless connection**.
### 5. Encoder and Decoder
**Encoder** is a device that converts digital signals into a form that can pass through a transmission medium.
**Decoder** is a device that converts encoded signals back into digital form.
It is not possible to communicate without encoder and decoder.

## Data Transmission Mode
The way in which data is transmitted from one place to another is called **data transmission mode**.
### Types of Transmission Modes
There are 3 types:
  1. Simplex Mode
  2. Half Duplex mode
  3. Full Duplex Mode
### 1. Simplex Mode :poop:
- data can only flow in one direction
- direction of flow never changes
- a device with simplex mode can either send or receive data (it can't perform both funcitons)
